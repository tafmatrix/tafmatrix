Hi, Iâ€™m Tahoor Alam Farooqi ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a Network Engineer with experience at Capgemini. Iâ€™m passionate about cybersecurity, automation, and modern networking technologies. Iâ€™m currently pursuing my CCIE Security (Integrated Program) while working on projects related to routing & switching, firewalls (Palo Alto, FortiGate), and network automation.

I love building practical solutions, exploring new tech, and sharing knowledge through code. On GitHub, youâ€™ll find my networking scripts, automation tools, and cybersecurity projects.

Letâ€™s connect and collaborate on innovative tech projects!
